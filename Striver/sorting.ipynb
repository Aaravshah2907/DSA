    "##### Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we will select the range of the unsorted array using a loop (say i) that indicates the starting index of the range. The loop will run forward from 0 to n-1. The value i = 0 means the range is from 0 to n-1, and similarly, i = 1 means the range is from 1 to n-1, and so on. (Initially, the range will be the whole array starting from the first index.)\n",
    "- Now, in each iteration, we will select the minimum element from the range of the unsorted array using an inner loop.\n",
    "- After that, we will swap the minimum element with the first element of the selected range(in step 1). \n",
    "- Finally, after each iteration, we will find that the array is sorted up to the first index of the range. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Here, after each iteration, the array becomes sorted up to the first index of the range. That is why the starting index of the range increases by 1 after each iteration. This increment is achieved by the outer loop and the starting index is represented by variable i in the following code. And the inner loop(i.e. j) helps to find the minimum element of the range [iâ€¦..n-1]."
